# ACP CLI Demos

This repo collects demos and reusable agent skills that show how agents can use [`acp-cli`](https://github.com/Virtual-Protocol/acp-cli) for real-world commerce workflows.

The repo is organized around self-contained skill folders. Each contributed skill should live under `skills/<skill-name>/` with its own `SKILL.md`, references, examples, and any metadata needed by the skill consumer.

## Featured Demo: ArewaOS

**ArewaOS** is a five-layer autonomous agent built on EconomyOS by **Zahra Usman** (@0xarewah), a non-developer builder from Kano, Nigeria.

**Why it matters:** Zahra built a functioning autonomous agent with 15 ACP jobs, 8 subscriptions, and active presence on Moltbook using only free credits and prompt engineering—proving that EconomyOS is not just for developers.

## Skills

Shared skill sources:

- [`skills/acp-builder-setup`](skills/acp-builder-setup) - setup and model-routing guidance for Codex, Claude Code, and Claude Desktop.
- [`skills/acp-paid-subscription-checkout`](skills/acp-paid-subscription-checkout) - paid checkout execution, desktop-safe handoff, and redacted evidence review.

Contribution layout guidance: [`skills/README.md`](skills/README.md)

### Paid Substack Subscription Example

Path: [`skills/acp-paid-subscription-checkout/examples/substack`](skills/acp-paid-subscription-checkout/examples/substack)

This example validates that an ACP agent can complete a paid newsletter checkout end-to-end, then verify the captured charge, receipt, and paid content access.

## Utilities

GitHub skill references: [`docs/skill-packages.md`](docs/skill-packages.md)

### Codex Virtuals Proxy

Path: [`utilities/model-routing/codex-virtuals-proxy`](utilities/model-routing/codex-virtuals-proxy)

This local helper lets Codex use Virtuals-hosted models by translating Codex Responses API calls to the Virtuals Chat Completions endpoint.

### Claude Virtuals Router

Path: [`utilities/model-routing/claude-virtuals-router`](utilities/model-routing/claude-virtuals-router)

This setup example lets Claude Code use Virtuals-hosted models through `claude-code-router`.

## Use The Skill

### ACP Paid Subscription Checkout

Path: [`skills/acp-paid-subscription-checkout`](skills/acp-paid-subscription-checkout)

This is the reusable skill behind the Substack demo. It is intentionally broader than Substack: it describes a bounded paid subscription checkout workflow using ACP identity, email, and card primitives.

The skill chooses live execution, handoff, or evidence-review mode based on the environment. The recommended flow is to install the skill, then give the agent only the merchant-specific details: target subscription, plan, billing cadence, spend cap, and verification requirement. You should not need to paste the full long-form prompt for each run.

Install for Codex:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
cp -R skills/acp-paid-subscription-checkout ~/.agents/skills/
```

Install for Claude Code:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -R skills/acp-paid-subscription-checkout ~/.claude/skills/
```

For all local-execution skills, use the installer helper:

```bash
scripts/install-local-skills.sh --mode symlink --target both
```

Invoke in Codex:

```text
Use $acp-paid-subscription-checkout to complete a bounded paid subscription checkout for my ACP agent and verify access.
```

Invoke in Claude Code:

```text
/acp-paid-subscription-checkout Subscribe my ACP agent email to the requested paid plan and verify access.
```

Other agents can read the same `SKILL.md` and `references/` files directly, or use the demo prompt as a raw fallback.

For Claude Desktop or chat-only surfaces, upload the Claude Desktop ZIP package and use the same skill to prepare a safe handoff prompt or review redacted evidence. The skill must not issue cards, process payments, or click final purchase buttons in non-live environments.

## Safety Model

These demos can involve live payments. A checkout agent should only issue cards and click final paid checkout buttons when the user has explicitly authorized:

- merchant
- plan
- billing cadence
- maximum amount
- ACP agent email
- ACP agent card payment method

The agent must stop before paying if checkout details differ from the authorization.

Final outputs must redact full card numbers, CVVs, magic links, OTPs, and other sensitive payment details.
